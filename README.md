# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions.

## Developing

After cloning or copying a project and installing dependencies with `pnpm install`, you can start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
