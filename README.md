# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions.

## Developing

After cloning or copying a project and installing dependencies with `bun install`, you can start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
