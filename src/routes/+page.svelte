		With a decade of experience as a civil engineer, I made the exciting transition to software
		development, discovering a true passion for coding along the way. As a software developer, I
		leverage my engineering background to devise effective solutions and enhance user experiences
		through technology. My experience includes substantial work in JavaScript development, along
		with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and frameworks like SvelteKit, Next.js, and Astro.
		Committed to staying current with industry trends and continuously expanding my skill set, I am
		eager to tackle new challenges and explore full-stack development by integrating my front-end
		knowledge with back-end technologies.
